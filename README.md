# weather-app

## Description

- I built this weather app to practice using the fetch api.
- This weather app takes a city name as an input and shows you the weather for the day as well as the 5-day forecast.
- Once you search a city it is then saved to local storage
- It was a good experience to use the geo-coding api and the weather api at the same time!
